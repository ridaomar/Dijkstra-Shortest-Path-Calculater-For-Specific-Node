# Dijkstra-Shortest-Path-Calculater-For-Specific-Node
Dijkstra Shortest Path Calculater for a specific node in Javascript with Bootstrap 5 UI

DEMO: https://ridaomar.github.io/Dijkstra-Shortest-Path-Calculater-For-Specific-Node

This repository is just a homework solution for my graduate studies in the Department of Computer Networks and Communications at University of Benghazi. So, if you need to calcuate the shortest path of some network topology using Dijkstra algorithm I think this code will help you.

PS: It also has an easy-to-use interface developed by Bootstrap 5 framework.
